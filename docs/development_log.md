#### VAPI Service Implementation Update

Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Raheem. Starting the voice integration phase with updating the VAPI service to match the official documentation:

##### Tasks:
1. Fix VAPI method names:
   - [x] Update `startCall` to `start`
   - [x] Update `sendMessage` to `send`
   - [x] Update `stopCall` to `stop`
   - [x] Fix `setMuted` implementation

2. Create Basic Voice Agent UI:
   - [ ] Create minimal voice chat interface
   - [ ] Add basic controls (start/stop/mute)
   - [ ] Implement event handling

Alhamdulillah, completed the VAPI service implementation with correct method names and parameters. The service now properly handles:
- Starting calls with assistant configuration or ID
- Sending messages with role and content
- Managing call lifecycle (start/stop)
- Microphone mute control
- Event streaming for call status updates

Next step is to create a basic voice chat UI for agent interactions.

May Allah guide us in implementing these voice features correctly and make them beneficial for the users. Ameen.
