## Technical Details

### Custom Encryption Implementation
- Created `EncryptionService` as a singleton to handle encryption/decryption
- Uses AES encryption from the encrypt package
- Password-based key derivation using SHA-256
- Initialization vector (IV) stored in secure storage
- Provides encrypt/decrypt methods for string values

### ObjectBox Database Setup
- Created ObjectBoxManager to handle database initialization
- Used the generated code from ObjectBox to create and access the store
- Added support for custom encryption of sensitive fields
- Implemented repository pattern for data access

### Entity Models
- Each class is annotated with @Entity for ObjectBox
- Added custom methods to models for business logic
- Used PropertyType.date annotation to specify date storage format
- Added helper methods to convert between enums and storable types

### Emergency Response Feature Implementation
- Implemented the complete emergency response flow:
  - User can initiate an emergency session via a floating action button
  - Active sessions display a timer showing elapsed time
  - Sessions track intensity, triggers, and success/failure
  - Users can add notes and helpful strategies when ending a session
  - Implemented session resolution with customizable end time
- Used Riverpod for state management:
  - EmergencySessionProvider manages session state and database operations
  - EmergencyTimerProvider handles elapsed time tracking
- Created reusable UI components for emergency tips and quick actions

### Authentication Implementation
- Implemented a secure authentication flow:
  - Password hashing with salt using SHA-256
  - Clear warnings about the importance of password retention
  - Password strength validation and confirmation
  - User type confirmation for important security notices
- Used Riverpod for state management:
  - AuthProvider tracks authentication status (new user, existing user, authenticated)
  - Proper error handling and loading states
- Created reusable UI components for authentication screens

### Next Steps
1. Complete the ForgotPasswordScreen
2. Test the complete authentication and emergency response flow
3. Implement trigger management domain and presentation layers
4. Create trigger management screens
