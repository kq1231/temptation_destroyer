### Bug Fixes - [Date: 2025-04-14]
- Fixed dependency conflict with flutter_secure_storage by using compatible versions (22:48 PKT)
- Fixed login button activation issue in LoginScreen (22:50 PKT)
  - Added proper state tracking for password field content
  - Implemented text change listener to update button state
  - Improved user experience by immediately reflecting input state

## Technical Details

### Custom Encryption Implementation
- Created `EncryptionService` as a singleton to handle encryption/decryption
- Uses AES encryption from the encrypt package
- Password-based key derivation using SHA-256
- Initialization vector (IV) stored in secure storage
- Provides encrypt/decrypt methods for string values

### ObjectBox Database Setup
- Created ObjectBoxManager to handle database initialization
- Used the generated code from ObjectBox to create and access the store
- Added support for custom encryption of sensitive fields
- Implemented repository pattern for data access

### Entity Models
- Each class is annotated with @Entity for ObjectBox
- Added custom methods to models for business logic
- Used PropertyType.date annotation to specify date storage format
- Added helper methods to convert between enums and storable types

### Emergency Response Feature Implementation
- Implemented the complete emergency response flow:
  - User can initiate an emergency session via a floating action button
  - Active sessions display a timer showing elapsed time
  - Sessions track intensity, triggers, and success/failure
  - Users can add notes and helpful strategies when ending a session
  - Implemented session resolution with customizable end time
- Used Riverpod for state management:
  - EmergencySessionProvider manages session state and database operations
  - EmergencyTimerProvider handles elapsed time tracking
- Created reusable UI components for emergency tips and quick actions

### Authentication Implementation
- Implemented a secure authentication flow:
  - Password hashing with salt using SHA-256
  - Clear warnings about the importance of password retention
  - Password strength validation and confirmation
  - User type confirmation for important security notices
- Used Riverpod for state management:
  - AuthProvider tracks authentication status (new user, existing user, authenticated)
  - Proper error handling and loading states
- Created reusable UI components for authentication screens

### Password Recovery System Design
- Security questions-based approach:
  - Will allow users to set up personal security questions during setup
  - Answers will be stored securely (encrypted with a key derived from the answers)
  - Recovery flow will ask these questions and verify answers
  - If correct, will show password hint or allow password reset
  - Will clearly warn that old encrypted data becomes inaccessible
- Recovery codes alternative:
  - Will generate recovery codes during initial setup
  - Users will be encouraged to store these codes safely
  - Will provide a recovery flow using these codes

### Next Steps (For April 15, 2025)
1. Implement ForgotPasswordScreen and password recovery system:
   - Create SecurityQuestionsSetupScreen for collecting security questions during initial setup
   - Implement password recovery flow using security questions
   - Add recovery codes generation and management
   - Add clear warnings about data loss when resetting password

2. Begin implementing trigger management:
   - Create domain layer use cases for trigger management
   - Build TriggerCollectionScreen UI
   - Implement trigger creation and editing functionality

3. Enhance app stability:
   - Add proper error handling for database operations
   - Test the complete authentication flow
   - Validate the emergency response flow end-to-end
